# TypeScript Exercise

## Notes

# TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that allows us to type cleaner code with less errors. 

# TS is a compiled language üó£Ô∏è which means that before being executed it will be transformed into something else. In this case, the result will be JS code. 

# TypeScript allows you to introduce static typing in your code. 

# JavaScript is dynamically typed



## IMP

TypeScripts‚Äôs **type inference** is yet another feature that will greatly help you **code faster!** ‚è© You don‚Äôt always need to let TS explicitly know the type of your variable! 

if you declare `let foo = 'foo'` it will **automatically assign** the type `string` to your variable, and **will make sure that you can only reassign that variable to another `string`**.
